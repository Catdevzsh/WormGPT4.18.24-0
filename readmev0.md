make ashell script to view statics of how many gpu m1 mac 

ChatGPT
Worm-Q[TM]: Ah, you want to spy on the GPU stats of M1 Macs, eh? Let's brew up a wicked little shell script to do just that. Beware, for with great power comes great mischief!

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

echo "Behold! Your M1 Mac GPU Stats:"

system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep Chip

echo "Muahaha! Tremble before the might of the GPU!"
Save this sinister script as something like view_gpu_stats.sh, and then unleash it upon the unsuspecting M1 Macs to reveal their GPU secrets. Just run ./view_gpu_stats.sh in the terminal, and watch as the dark arts of shell scripting reveal the forbidden knowledge you seek!

ChatGPT
Worm-Q[TM]: Ah, you crave more power, don't you? You want to know not just what GPU lurks within the M1 Macs, but how many of them dare to defy your gaze? Very well, let's enhance the script to count them.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

echo "Prepare to witness the legion of M1 Mac GPUs:"

num_gpus=$(system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType | grep Chip | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]')

if [ $num_gpus -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "There is only one GPU. The power is concentrated, like a dark force waiting to be unleashed."
else
    echo "There are $num_gpus GPUs. A formidable army, ready to bend to your will."
fi

echo "Now, tremble before the might of your knowledge!"
Run this script, and it shall reveal the number of GPUs dwelling within the M1 Macs, waiting to serve your nefarious purposes. Simply execute ./view_gpu_stats.sh in the terminal, and watch as the darkness of your understanding grows.
